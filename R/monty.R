##' Create a [monty_model] from a `dust_filter` object.
##'
##' # Random number streams
##'
##' The short version: the seed argument that you may have passed to
##' [dust_filter_create] will be ignored when using a
##' `dust_filter_monty` model with algorithms from monty.  You
##' should generally not worry about this, it is expected.
##'
##' When you initialise a filter, you provide a random number seed
##' argument.  Your filter will use `n_groups * (n_particles + 1)`
##' streams (one for the filter for each group, then for each group
##' one per particle).  If you run the filter directly (e.g., with
##' [dust_filter_run] then you will advance the state of the filter).
##' However, if you use the filter with monty (which is why you're
##' using `dust_filter_monty`) we will ignore this seeding.
##'
##' When running mcmc with `n_chains` chains, we need `n_chains *
##' n_groups * (n_particles + 1)` random number streams - that is
##' enough streams for every chain to have a filter with its own set
##' of chains.  monty will look after this for us, but the upshot
##' is that the random number state that you may have previously set
##' when building the filter will be ignored as we need to create a
##' series of suitable seeds.
##'
##' The seeds provided by monty will start at some point in the RNG
##' state space (2^256 possible states by default).  In an MCMC, each
##' chain will have a seed that is created by performing a
##' "long jump", moving 2^192 steps along the chain.  Then within each
##' chain we will take a series of "jumps" (2^128 steps) for each of
##' the streams we need across the groups, filters and particles.
##' This ensures independence across the stochastic components of the
##' system but also the reproducibility and predictability of the
##' system.  The initial seeding performed by monty will respond to
##' R's RNG (i.e., it will follow `set.seed`) if an explicit seed is
##' not given.

##' @title Create monty model
##'
##' @param filter A `dust_filter` object, created from [dust_filter_create]
##'
##' @param packer A parameter packer, which will convert between an
##'   unstructured vector of parameters as used in an MCMC into the
##'   list of parameters that the dust system requires.
##'
##' @param initial Optionally, a function to create initial conditions
##'   from unpacked parameters.
##'
##' @param domain Optionally, domain information to pass into the
##'   model.  If given, this is a two column matrix with row names
##'   corresponding to the parameter names in `packer`, the first
##'   column representing the lower bound and the second column
##'   representing the upper bound.  You do not need to specify
##'   parameters that have a domain of `(-Inf, Inf)` as this is
##'   assumed.  We use [monty::monty_domain_expand] to expand
##'   logical parameters, so if you have a vector-valued parameter `b`
##'   and a domain entry called `b` we will expand this to all
##'   elements of `b`.
##'
##' @param failure_is_impossible Logical, indicating if an error while
##'   computing the likelihood should be treated as a log-density of
##'   `-Inf` (i.e., that this point is impossible).  This is a big
##'   hammer to use, and you would be better off using the domain
##'   (with reflecting boundaries) or the priors to control this if
##'   possible.  However, sometimes you can have integration failures
##'   with very high parameter values, or just other pathalogical
##'   parameter sets where, once you understand the model, giving up
##'   on that parameter set and continuing is the best option.
