\usage{
dust_unfilter_run(
  unfilter,
  pars,
  initial = NULL,
  save_history = FALSE,
  adjoint = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{unfilter}{A \code{dust_unfilter} object, created by
\link{dust_unfilter_create}}

\item{pars}{Optional parameters to run the filter with.  If not
provided, parameters are not updated}

\item{initial}{Optional initial conditions, as a matrix (state x
particle) or 3d array (state x particle x group).  If not
provided, the system initial conditions are used.}

\item{save_history}{Logical, indicating if the simulation history
should be saved while the simulation runs; this has a small
overhead in runtime and in memory.  History (particle
trajectories) will be saved at each time in the filter.  If the
filter was constructed using a non-\code{NULL} \code{index} parameter,
the history is restricted to these states.}

\item{adjoint}{Enable adjoint history saving.  This is enabled
even when your model does not support adjoints!  But you won't
be able to look up gradients still.}
}
\value{
A vector of likelihood values, with as many elements as
there are groups.
